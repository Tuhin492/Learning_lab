This helps minimize the time that the poultry spends in the temperature danger zone where bacteria can multiply rapidly.<br>2. Controlled thawing: When using the defrost setting on a microwave oven, it provides a controlled thawing process that avoids uneven thawing or partial cooking of the poultry. The microwave oven uses low-power microwave energy to thaw the poultry evenly.<br><br>However, it is important to follow these guidelines when thawing poultry in a microwave oven:<br>Follow the manufacturer's instructions for using the defrost setting on your specific microwave oven.<br>Place the poultry in a microwave-safe container or dish to catch any drips or juices.<br>Monitor the thawing process closely to ensure that the poultry does not begin to cook in any areas. If partial cooking occurs, it's important to immediately continue cooking the poultry to a safe internal temperature.<br>Cook the poultry immediately after thawing to ensure food safety.<br><br><br>Keeping it properly covered on the kitchen counter: Thawing poultry on the kitchen counter at room temperature is not recommended as it allows the outer layers of the poultry to reach temperatures within the temperature danger zone while the inner parts are still frozen. This can promote bacterial growth and increase the risk of foodborne illness.<br><br>Placing it in a bowl of water in the sink: Thawing poultry in water in the sink is a common method, but it requires careful attention to food safety. The poultry should be placed in a leak-proof plastic bag and submerged in cold water. The water should be changed every 30 minutes to maintain a safe temperature. This method can take a significant amount of time and requires continuous monitoring.<br><br>Keeping it in a closed kitchen cabinet: Thawing poultry in a closed kitchen cabinet is not recommended as it can promote bacterial growth. The temperature inside a closed cabinet may not be consistent or cool enough to keep the poultry safe during thawing.<br><br>In summary, the safest way to thaw frozen poultry that needs to be cooked immediately is to thaw it in a microwave oven, following the manufacturer's instructions for the defrost setting.

    description: "In a food processing plant, maintaining proper hygiene and minimizing the risk of cross-contamination is crucial. When it comes to drying washed hands, using disposable paper towels is considered the best practice.<br><br>Your personal handkerchief: Using your personal handkerchief is not recommended for drying hands in a food processing plant. Personal handkerchiefs may harbor bacteria and other contaminants, which can pose a risk of cross-contamination. It is best to avoid using personal items for hand drying in a food processing environment to maintain hygiene and prevent the spread of potential contaminants.<br><br> A hand drier: While hand dryers are commonly found in various settings, they may not be the ideal choice for a food processing plant. Hand dryers can generate airflow that may contribute to the dispersal of microorganisms in the surrounding environment, potentially leading to cross-contamination. Additionally, hand dryers may not effectively dry hands as thoroughly as other methods.<br><br>A roller towel: The use of roller towels is also not recommended in processing plant. Roller towels can become contaminated over time, especially if they are not regularly cleaned and maintained. This can increase the risk of cross-contamination and compromise food safety.<br><br><br>Disposable paper towels are the preferred option for drying hands in a food processing plant. They offer several advantages, including:<br>1. Hygiene: Disposable paper towels are single-use and prevent the spread of bacteria and other contaminants from person to person. Each user gets a fresh, clean towel, reducing the risk of cross-contamination.<br>2. Absorbency: Paper towels have excellent absorbency, effectively drying hands and removing moisture. This is important for maintaining good hand hygiene, as moist hands can promote bacterial growth.<br>3. Convenience: Disposable paper towels are readily available and easy to use. They can be conveniently placed near handwashing stations for quick access.<br>4. Disposal: After use, paper towels can be disposed of in a hygienic manner, ensuring cleanliness and reducing the risk of contamination."

    question: "Which one of the following statements is INCORRECT with respect to fortification of milk powder?", 
    answers: ["It is fortified with Vitamins A and D","It is to be used in Government funded programmes to prepare Reconstituted Fortified Milk","Once pack is opened, it should be stored in an airtight container for up to one month","Fortification levels in Reconstituted Fortified Milk, should comply with levels in fortified milk"],
    correct: "Once pack is opened, it should be stored in an airtight container for up to one month",
    description: "Once the pack is opened, it should be stored in an airtight container for up to one month This statement is incorrect. Once the pack of milk powder is opened, it is important to store it properly to maintain its quality. However, storing it in an airtight container for up to one month is not recommended. After opening, milk powder is susceptible to moisture absorption, which can lead to clumping and spoilage. It is generally recommended to transfer the remaining powder to a clean, dry, and airtight container, and to use it within a reasonable timeframe, following the manufacturer's guidelines."
