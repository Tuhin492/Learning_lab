    description: "The first step in the treatment of sewage is typically screening. Screening involves the removal of large solids from the sewage by passing it through a series of screens or mesh filters. This process helps to prevent clogging and damage to downstream equipment and pipelines. The screens or filters used in screening can vary in size and design, but their primary function is to capture and remove solid debris such as stones, sticks, rags, and other large objects present in the sewage.<br><br>After screening, the sewage undergoes further treatment processes such as <b>grit removal, sedimentation, biological treatment, and disinfection</b> to remove smaller solids, organic matter, and harmful pathogens. The treated sewage can then be safely discharged or reused depending on the specific requirements and regulations.<br><br>Disposal of effluent and sludge digestion are subsequent steps in the sewage treatment process and come after screening. Therefore, they are not the first step in the treatment process."

    correct: "Thaw it in a microwave oven",
    description: "Thawing poultry in a microwave oven is a safe method because it allows for quick and controlled thawing. Here's why:<br>1. Quick thawing: Microwave ovens have a defrost setting specifically designed to thaw frozen food quickly. This helps minimize the time that the poultry spends in the temperature danger zone where bacteria can multiply rapidly.<br>2. Controlled thawing: When using the defrost setting on a microwave oven, it provides a controlled thawing process that avoids uneven thawing or partial cooking of the poultry. The microwave oven uses low-power microwave energy to thaw the poultry evenly.<br><br>However, it is important to follow these guidelines when thawing poultry in a microwave oven:<br>Follow the manufacturer's instructions for using the defrost setting on your specific microwave oven.<br>Place the poultry in a microwave-safe container or dish to catch any drips or juices.<br>Monitor the thawing process closely to ensure that the poultry does not begin to cook in any areas. If partial cooking occurs, it's important to immediately continue cooking the poultry to a safe internal temperature.<br>Cook the poultry immediately after thawing to ensure food safety.<br><br><br>Keeping it properly covered on the kitchen counter: Thawing poultry on the kitchen counter at room temperature is not recommended as it allows the outer layers of the poultry to reach temperatures within the temperature danger zone while the inner parts are still frozen. This can promote bacterial growth and increase the risk of foodborne illness.<br><br>Placing it in a bowl of water in the sink: Thawing poultry in water in the sink is a common method, but it requires careful attention to food safety. The poultry should be placed in a leak-proof plastic bag and submerged in cold water. The water should be changed every 30 minutes to maintain a safe temperature. This method can take a significant amount of time and requires continuous monitoring.<br><br>Keeping it in a closed kitchen cabinet: Thawing poultry in a closed kitchen cabinet is not recommended as it can promote bacterial growth.

    correct: "Cholecalciferol",
    description: "When 7-dehydrocholesterol, a compound present in the skin, is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, it undergoes a photochemical reaction and is converted into cholecalciferol. Cholecalciferol is also known as Vitamin D3, which is a biologically inactive form of Vitamin D. <br><br>(Once cholecalciferol is formed, it undergoes further metabolic processes in the liver and kidneys to be converted into its active form, calcitriol.

    correct: "It can distinguish between weight gained as fat and as lean body mass",
    description: "Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) is a method used to assess the quality of a food protein based on its ability to support growth in animals, typically weanling rats. However, PER cannot distinguish between weight gained as fat and as lean body mass.<br><br>The PER test involves feeding a test protein to weanling rats for a specific duration, usually three weeks, and measuring the gain in body weight. The gain in body weight is then divided by the amount of protein consumed to calculate the PER value. Higher PER values indicate better protein quality, as they represent greater weight gain per unit of protein consumed.<br><br>However, the PER test does not provide information about the composition of the weight gained. It cannot differentiate between weight gained as fat or as lean body mass, as it only assesses overall weight gain. Other methods, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) or body composition analysis, are more suitable for distinguishing between fat and lean body mass."

    correct: "Myoinositol hexaphosphate",
    description: "Myoinositol hexaphosphate, also known as phytic acid or phytate, is an antinutrient that binds to divalent metal ions such as iron, zinc, and calcium. Phytic acid is found in many plant-based foods, particularly in seeds, grains, and legumes. When consumed, phytic acid can form complexes with these metal ions, inhibiting their absorption and adversely affecting their bioavailability.<br><br>Phytic acid's ability to bind to iron, zinc, and calcium can contribute to mineral deficiencies in individuals who rely heavily on plant-based diets. This is because the bound minerals are less available for absorption by the human body. Soaking, fermenting, or cooking food can help to partially break down phytic acid and improve mineral bioavailability.<br><br>On the other hand, amylase inhibitors are compounds that inhibit the enzyme amylase, which is responsible for breaking down starch. Tetrahydrolipstatin is a drug used for weight management that works by inhibiting the activity of pancreatic lipases. Protease inhibitors, as the name suggests, inhibit the activity of proteases, which are enzymes that break down proteins."
